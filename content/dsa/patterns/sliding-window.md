# Sliding Window Pattern

## Description
The sliding window pattern is used to perform operations on a specific window size of an array or string, such as finding the longest subarray or substring that satisfies a given condition.

## When to Use
- Problems involving subarrays or substrings
- Finding optimal window size
- Maximum/minimum sum of k consecutive elements

## Common Problems
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Minimum Window Substring
- Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the length of the array/string

## Space Complexity
O(1) to O(k) depending on the problem
