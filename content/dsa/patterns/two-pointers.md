# Two Pointers Pattern

## Description
The two pointers technique is a common algorithmic pattern where two pointers traverse a data structure in tandem until one or both pointers hit a certain condition.

## When to Use
- Working with sorted arrays or linked lists
- Need to find pairs or triplets with specific properties
- Optimization problems requiring O(n) time complexity

## Common Problems
- Two Sum (sorted array)
- Container With Most Water
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Valid Palindrome

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the length of the array

## Space Complexity
O(1) - only uses two pointers
