# Binary Search Pattern

## Description
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## When to Use
- Searching in a sorted array
- Finding boundaries or pivot points
- Optimization problems with monotonic functions

## Common Problems
- Binary Search
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- Find First and Last Position of Element
- Search a 2D Matrix

## Time Complexity
O(log n) where n is the length of the array

## Space Complexity
O(1) for iterative, O(log n) for recursive
